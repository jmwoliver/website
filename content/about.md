Hello! I'm Jacob Woliver and this is a place for me to [handmake](https://handmade.network/manifesto) [lame things](http://www.paulgraham.com/early.html). I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Posit](https://posit.co/) working on their [Package Manager](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/package-manager/). I also love making neat bits and bobs and writing about them here.

Feel free to reach out with any of the contacts below!
