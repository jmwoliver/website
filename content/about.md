Hello! This is a place for me to [make lame things so I can eventually make great things](http://www.paulgraham.com/early.html). I currently do backend Go development at RStudio on the Package Manager team. I have a personal interest in computer graphics and game engines with an affinity towards making neat little bits and bobs.

Feel free to reach out with any of the contacts below!
