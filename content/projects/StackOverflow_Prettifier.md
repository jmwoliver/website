[StackOverflow Prettifier](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stack-overflow-prettifier/) is a Firefox extention that that hides all the pointless features of StackOverflow and leaves only the useful bits.

The miniscule source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmwoliver/stack_prettifier).

# Sales Pitch

Have you ever gone to StackOverflow to research a question for work and next thing you know you’re 30 clicks deep into sidebar links reading how to make BBQ Sausages? On one hand it’s pretty cool to read about and you effectively got paid hundreds to do so, but perhaps it’s not the best decision for the longevity of your career.

This extension removes the annoying parts of the sidebar entirely! It does away with job offers, hot network questions, etc, and only leaves the Related section. Don't waste your day on BBQ Sausages any longer, download [StackOverflow Prettifier](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stack-overflow-prettifier/) today!

# Limitations

* It'd be nice to be able to toggle certain sections on/off depending on if you like them (but who really cares about hot network questions?)
* StackOverflow seems to change the IDs that I search on every once in a while, which breaks things. It'd be better if the extension was a little more resilient to that.
* I've been told a Chrome extension would be good, but I like to fight the Google Tech Oligarchy any way I can.
